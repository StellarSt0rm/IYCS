## Enhancements in IYCS

### Filters:
- **Refined Organization**: Filters are categorized into three sections: "Filters", "Sort Method", and "Other".
  - *Filters*: All filters can be paired with each other, enabling simultaneous filtering. For instance, you can filter by "Hearted" and "Links" to view hearted items with links.
  - *Sort Method*: Sorting options are independent, except for "Sort Direction" which dictates the direction of the sorting.
  - *Other*: Includes "All" to display all items, and "Clear" to reset selected filters and search (configurable in options).

### Options:

  - **Autoload**:
    - *Comments*: Enables automatic loading of comments. Set a limit for loaded comments.
    - *Chat Replay*: (Not yet implemented) Enables automatic loading of chat replay / live chat.
    - *Transcript*: Enables automatic loading of the transcript.
